            This project is a look through the history of Formula 1, with individual pages
            styled to and containing relevant information about each of the 8 decades
            Formula 1 has been around. You can take a peek at the fantastical beginnings of 
            this sport in the 1950s to the new technology and stars inspiring millions of 
            people in the 2020s. Each webpage contains fun facts and information about that
            decade as a whole, including driver interviews wherever possible, the standout
            drivers and teams of that decade, as well as some pictures of historical tracks
            and cars that were used.
