    <p>
        This was the first decade of the formula 1 championship, running in format
        very different to what it is nowadays. The format back then was as follows:
        7+ championship races (it changed through the seasons) throughout the season 
        with points awarded to the top 5 finishers on an 8-6-4-3-2 basis, with an 
        extra point for getting the fastest lap of the race. However, only the best 
        4 results counted toward the championship.
